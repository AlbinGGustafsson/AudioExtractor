# AudioExtractor
This is a command-line program designed to extract audio from MP4 video files using FFmpeg. Users can provide input video files, specify the start and end times for extraction, and define the output audio file name. The extracted audio will be saved as an MP3 file within the "output" folder.

I created this program because I was in search of a convenient way to extract a specific portion of audio from a video file. I found that many existing programs had too much overhead and featured more functionalities than I needed. So, I decided to develop a simpler solution that focuses specifically on the task of extracting audio from videos with ease.

You need FFmpeg to use it
